                    An easy way to reduce your carbon footprint is to buy loclly produced products. When you purchase local stuff, instead of buying products that were shipped from far away,
                    you are actually supporting local brands. And also, processed goods take a lot of energy, first for processing and then, the fuel consumption in transportation

                    As responsible citizens of the world. It is our duty to do out a bit to take care of it. You may think you won't make much of difference, especially if most other people
                    aren't too pressed about the Earth. But as they say, every drop makes the ocean. And in much the same way, we must strive to give back to Mother Nature as best as we can,
                    in our own small ways.

                    One of the easiest and most effective ways to help wildlife is to preserve the environment in which the animals live. Volunteer with organizations in your area to restore
                     native forests, grasslands, and coastal ecosystems by planting native species, manually removing invasive plant species, and taking out old fences.
